# Priority Queues and Heaps

## Summary
### Describe the behavior of the priority queue data type.
>  When removing an element from a priority queue, the element with the highest priority is retrieved.

### Describe the heap data structure and the efficiency of its operations.
> * A heap is an almost complete tree in which the values of all nodes are at least as large as those of their descendants.
> * Inserting or removing a heap element is an O(log(n)) operation.
> * The regular layout of a heap makes it possible to store heap nodes efficiently in an array.

### Describe the heapsort algorithm and its run-time performance.
> * The heapsort algorithm is based on inserting elements into a heap and removing them in sorted order.
> * Heapsort is an O(n log(n)) algorithm.
